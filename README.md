Plan is to have this repo have a load of commands (found in cog folder) and you can just pick the ones you want to use and which you don't

Current Commands:
Replay (proof of concept)

Replay Command: 
You give it the showdown replay link and it will output a formatted message of the two players that battled in the format: player_1 vs player_2 (newline) replay_link
